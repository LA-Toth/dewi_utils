# This package contains a framework for syncing files from the source code to a remote server
# in almost realtime. The file changes are watched, and based on actual rules the files are copied
# to their location with file name changes if necessary, or changing file content by using placeholders.
#
# An example usage can be found in dewi.commands.codesync.
# NOTE: the command will exist and work only when current Python package is finished.
